              Their hardness is three and a half. The youngest, at three hundred years old amongst the jewels. 
						  They are brittle and weak, so they are not suited for battle. They are clumsy and ineffective and cannot do anything. 
            </p>

              Named in 1920 by Heinrich Laubmann and Hermann Steinmetz in allusion to its composition, a phosphate, 
						  and its physical structure, from the Greek phyllos for leaf, referring to its perfect cleavage. 
            </p>
						<p> 
              Phosphophyllite is highly valued by collectors for its delicate bluish green colour, but it is seldom cut because it is rare, fragile and brittle.
            </p>

						<p> transparency: transparent, translucent </p>
						<p> tenacity: brittle </p>
